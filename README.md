# Weather-Locator

This is a web application I developed that utilizes HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. This application allows the user to use a US zipcode
to search for Weather anywhere in the United States.

The application then returns the city, the current weather, and the 
current temperature of the inputed zipcode.
