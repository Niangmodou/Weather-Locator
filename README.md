# Weather-Locator

This is a web application I developed that utilizes HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. This application allows the user to use a US zipcode
to search for Weather anywhere in the United States.

The application then returns the city, the current weather, and the 
current temperature of the inputed zipcode. The application mainly
uses JavaScript to make calls to the OpenWeatherMap API. The 
OpenWeatherMap API returns a JSON object with all of the weather
data. This data is then parsed to retrieve the desired information.

I have also attached a python script that uses the requests library
to perform the same action.
